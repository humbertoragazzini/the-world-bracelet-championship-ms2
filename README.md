# **UX**

## **Strategy**

* **My idea**: The idea born originally when a saw my wife making a bracelet, she need to memorize every single pattern and repeated couples of times to
make the bracelet looks like a simple geometrical form, In that momment I thought why not, traslate all that conplexitie to a game, an this was the trigger to make this idea real.

* **Make an impact in the first visit**: The first page have to be a colorful and shocking to make the first visit a pleasurable but at the same time funny moment, for this reason the first page have to be a mix between the bracelet world and the most desired price of a attlete, a gold belt.
